    "\n",
    "Again, please follow the instructions and do the best you can. Look at the tutorial for examples, my answers for Homework 3 Part One, as well as the Beautiful Soup documentation, and any other Python resource (such as Stack overflow). As you get further into this assignment a lot of the trick will be using loops properly and appending information into lists. One of the great ways to carefully use Beautiful Soup is to first use find() to find the first instance of something and search through it. And then use find_all() to get a list of results that you must then loop through and search within."
