ls

1. HOW MANY ACCIDENTS? 
head -5 OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv 
wc -l OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv

*** The data has two header-like rows, so subtract two from the output of the next line to get the total number of incidents ***

2. ONLY SHOW EXPLOSIONS
grep "explosion" OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv
 
3. FILE OF ONLY 2017 ACCIDENTS, HOW MANY LINES?
grep "2017" OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv > 2017-fatalities.csv
wc -l 2017-fatalities.csv
*** No subtraction necessary since grep doesn't pick up header rows ***

4. ONLY THE FIRST LINE OF THE FILE
head -n 1 OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv

5. FILE OF FORKLIFT ACCIDENTS, HOW MANY ACCIDENTS?
grep "forklift" OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv > forklift-fatalities.csv
wc -l forklift-fatalities.csv

6. FILE OF CHRISTMAS EVE ACCIDENTS, HOW MANY?
grep "12/31" OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv > christmas-eve-fatalities.csv
wc -l christmas-eve-fatalities.csv
*** I tried to figure this out with awk '$1 == "12/31"' OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv so it would work in a dataset in which date-like numbers might appear outside of the date field but couldn't get it to work ***

7. TEXT FILE OF ACCIDENTS INVOLVING TREES
grep "tree" OSHA-fatalities-FY2017.csv > tree-fatalities.txt
